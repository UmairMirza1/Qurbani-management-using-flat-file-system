# Qurbani-management-using-flat-file-system

The database has been handled using pure flat file system 

Different design patterns have been implemented 
 --> Observer pattern 
 This keeps track of shares of the animals and updates in case of a purchase
 
 --> Factory method
 Hiding logic from client how the animal objects are made and providing a clean abstraction over creation process
 
 --> Singleton pattern 
 Restricting access to duplicate object creation and optimizing
